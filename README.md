# AI Image Classification App using Streamlit PyTorch

This project leverages the power of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to classify uploaded images and provides visual explanations for the model’s predictions through the Integrated Gradients method.

**Key Features:**
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in PNG, JPG, or JPEG formats and view them directly on the interface.

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a ResNet-50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to classify images.

- **Top Predictions:** Displays the top 5 predicted categories with their corresponding probabilities.

- **Model Interpretation:** Uses the Integrated Gradients method to highlight which parts of the image were most influential in the model’s decision.

- **Visualization:** Provides a side-by-side comparison of the original image and the interpretation, along with a bar chart of prediction probabilities.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.

- **PyTorch and Torchvision:** For loading and utilizing the ResNet-50 model.

- **Captum:** For model interpretability and the Integrated Gradients method.

- **Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations.

**Why This Project?**

Understanding how deep learning models make decisions is crucial for building trust and improving model performance. This dashboard not only classifies images but also provides insights into the model's decision-making process, making it a valuable tool for anyone interested in AI and machine learning.
